## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to HNGx org

hiii this is to co-ordinate stuff easily for the backend and mobile task, though itll probably expand

head over to the teams repo and make an issue or talk in the discussion

then go to the food-app or events-app repo and talk there

decide with everyone on your database etc.

team leads, text me @fumnanya in slack to get write access to the repo

no pne should commit to main, you should make branches and PR in
