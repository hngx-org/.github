## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to HNGx org

hiii this is to co-ordinate stuff easily for the backend and mobile tasks, though it'll probably expand

head over to the [teams repo](https://github.com/hngx-org/teams) and make an issue or talk in the discussion so you can get access to your team's private repo(s)

then go to the food-app or events-app repo and talk there so that you can decide with everyone on your database etc.

team leads:
- text me @[fumnanya](https://hngix.slack.com/team/U05QXUVNYBH) in slack to get write access to the repo
- don't give just anyone write access to the repos, if you mess up cos someone `git push --force`d, that's not my problem
- no one should commit to main, you should make branches and approve PRs
